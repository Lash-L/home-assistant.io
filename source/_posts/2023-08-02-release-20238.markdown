## Translated services

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve/extend story
- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshot

Sources:

- Add support for service translations ([@frenck] - [#95984]) ([light docs]) (noteworthy)
- Add support for service translations (#17264) @bramkragten

{% enddetails %}

All services in Home Assistant are now translatable! üåé

Services are the actions you can call, like turning on a light. This was one of
the bigger things in Home Assistant, that still was only available in English.

Starting this release, we are adding translations to these services. Hoping to
drasticly improve the experience when English is not your main language.

<p class='img'>

Temporary screenshot. My Home Assistant uses the Dutch language, and the service
to turn on a light is also translated into Dutch!
</p>

This is a big step forward! As a matter of fact, this change caused our
translations to grow and actually double! üòÖ

Because of that, It might take some time to translate all services; however...
You can help! You don't have to be a developer to help out with this, you can
do this from the comfort of your own browser. Check out our documentation on
[how to contribute translations](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/translations).

## Introducing the event entity

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve/extend story
- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshot

Sources:

- https://github.com/home-assistant/architecture/discussions/929
- https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/pull/17332
- Add MQTT event entity platform ([@jbouwh] - [#96876]) ([mqtt docs]) (new-platform) (new-integration)
- Add doorbell event support to alexa ([@jbouwh] - [#97092]) ([alexa docs])

{% enddetails %}

Events are signals that are emitted when something happens, for example, when
a user presses a physical button like a doorbell or when a button on a remote
control is pressed.

If you ever tried to work with events in Home Assistant, you probably noticed
that it is not the easiest thing to do. You need to know the event name,
and then you need to know the data that is being sent with it. Before you know it,
you'll start fiddling with the developer tools to figure out what is going on.

To make this all easier, we are introducing a new entity type this release: The event entity.

The event entity can capture these events in the physical world and makes them
available in Home Assistant as an entity.

The event entity can be used like any other entity in Home Assistant: They will
show up in the UI, can be used directly in the automations editor and provides
historical information in the logbook.

</p>

Besides [Matter](/integrations/matter), the event entity is also supported by
[HomeKit Devices](/integrations/homekit_controller), [MQTT](/integrations/mqtt),
and [Philips Hue](/integrations/hue). We expect to see more integrations
supporting this new entity type soon.

## Improving the first experience with Home Assistant

{% details "TODO" %}

- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshot

Sources:

- Use nominatim from openstreetmap for location search in onboarding (#17287) @bramkragten
- https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/pull/17287

{% enddetails %}

Onboarding is the first experience a user has with Home Assistant, and we want
to make it as smooth as possible. This release, we are improving the onboarding
experience by adding a search field to the map, so you can search for your
location instead of endless dragging the map around.

## Add items to your shopping list with Assist

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve/extend story
- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshot

{% enddetails %}

What if you could ask [Assist](/integrations/assist) to add items to your
Home Assistant [shopping list](/integrations/shopping_list)? Well, now you can!

> Add milk to my shopping list!

üòé

## Wildcard support for sentence triggers

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve/extend story
- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshot

Sources:

- https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/97236
- https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant.io/pull/28332

{% enddetails %}

‚ö†Ô∏è **This is pending a final review and might not make it into the release.**

Sentence triggers now support wildcards! This means you can now partially match
a sentence, and use the matched part in your actions. This is what powers the
above shopping list feature too and it can be used for many other things as well.

You could for example, create a sentence trigger that matches when you say:

> Play the white album by the beatles

Using the wildcard support, you can actually get the album and artist name
from the sentence, and use that in your actions.

Sentence trigger; `Play {album} by {artist}`

This will make `album` and `artist` available as trigger variables that you
can use in your actions; e.g., to start playing the music requested. Or maybe,
you could even ask to display an AI generated image on your TV using a prompt...

## Generate an image with OpenAI's DALL-E

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve/extend story
- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshot

Sources:

- https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/97018

{% enddetails %}

In the last release, we added the ability for service to respond with data,
and now we added a service that allows you to generate an image using
[OpenAI's DALL-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2).

All you need is having the [OpenAI conversation agent](/integrations/openai_conversation)
integration set up on your instance, and you will get a new service:
{% my developer_call_service service="openai_conversation.generate_image" %}.


Call this service describing the image you'd like the AI to generate, and
it will respond with an image URL you can use in your automations.

<p class='img'>

Temporary screenshot.
</p>

You could, for example use this to generate an image of a city that matches
the weather conditions outside of your home, let the AI generate an image
about the latest new headline to show on your dashboard, or maybe a nice
random piece of abstract art to show on your TV.

<p class='img'>

Temporary screenshot. AI generated image of New York based on the current weather state.
</p>

But if you combine it with the wildcard support for sentence triggers, you
could even ask Home Assistant to generate an image for you by using your voice!

## Condition selector

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve/extend story
- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshot

Sources:

- Add condition selector for blueprint (#17278) @piitaya
https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/pull/17278

{% enddetails %}

A new selector is available for use in, for example, blueprints:
[The condition selector](/docs/blueprint/selectors/#condition-selector).

This selector takes and shows the condition part of the automation editor,
and allows Blueprints creators to use a user-provided condition in their
blueprint.

There are much more easter bunnies in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:

- Tons of performance upgrades again this month (thanks [@bdraco]), these
  include a much faster ingress experience when visiting add-on web interfaces. üöÄ
- [@emontnemery] added filters to many of the services Home Assistant provides,
  meaning only options that are relevant to the entity you are calling the
  service on, will be shown in the UI. Nice!
- CO2Signal changed their name to [Electricity Maps]. The integration
  has been renamed to match that. Thanks, [@madsnedergaard]!
- [@Lash-L] keeps extending the [Roborock] integration, adding many new entities
  this release. This includes an error sensor, volume controls, and DnD setting
  times. Awesome!
- [EZVIZ] received a big update, adding support for alarm control panels, button,
  and select entities. Thanks [@RenierM26]!
- [@farmio] added support for adding [date] and [date/time] entities to [KNX]! Great!
- The [Xiaomi BLE] now supports for the MiScale (V1 and V2). Thanks [@Ernst79]!
- [UniFi Network] now has controls to enable and disable a UniFi WLAN, and added
  image entities for QR-codes for WLAN access. Thanks [@Kane610]!

## Breaking changes

{% details "Python 3.10 support has been removed" %}

Python 3.10 support has previously been deprecated and has now been removed.
Home Assistant now requires Python 3.11 to run.

If you are using Home Assistant OS, Home Assistant Container,
or Home Assistant Supervised installation method, you don‚Äôt have to do anything.
In those cases, we handle this all for you.

Your system has been using Python 3.11 for quite some time already.

([@frenck] - [#97007])

[@frenck]: https://github.com/frenck
[#97007]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/97007

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Ecovacs" %}

The Ecovacs integration has been migrated to the new "StateVacuumEntity"
under the hood.

The states of the vacuum entity now reports not only on or off,
instead `cleaning`, `paused`, `docked` (_implicit mean charging_),
`returning` (_to base_), `idle` and `error`. Further the actions `turn_on`
(_start cleaning_) and `turn_off` (_stop cleaning and return to base_) were
superseded by three single actions `start`, `stop` and `return_to_base`.

[@mib1185]: https://github.com/mib1185
[#95920]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/95920

{% enddetails %}

{% details "MQTT" %}

It's no longer allowed for an MQTT RGB light without a `brighness_state_topic`
to report an RGB value of `RGB=0,0,0`. The reason is that for such lights
the light's brightness is derived from the RGB value, and and RGB value
of `RGB=0,0,0` corresponds to a brightness of 0 which is not allowed.

In case an MQTT RGB light without a `brighness_state_topic` reports `0,0,0`
for R, G and B, that update will be ignored.

([@jbouwh] - [#96286]) ([documentation](/integrations/mqtt))

[@jbouwh]: https://github.com/jbouwh
[#96286]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/96286

---

The MQTT climate `CONF_POWER_STATE_TOPIC` and `CONF_POWER_STATE_TEMPLATE` were
depredated in HA Core 2023.2.0 and are now removed. Please remove these options
from your configuration. The options were not implemented but will break your
MQTT configuration if they are still present in your config.

([@jbouwh] - [#96771]) ([documentation](/integrations/mqtt))

[@jbouwh]: https://github.com/jbouwh
[#96771]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/96771

---

The way MQTT entities are named and how device configuration can be shared
between discovered entities has changed.

**Sharing of device configuration**

Discovered MQTT entities can share device configuration, meaning one entity
can include the full device configuration and other entities can link to that
device by only setting mandatory fields.

The mandatory fields were previously limited to at least one of
`connection` and `identifiers`, but has now been extended to at least
one of `connection` and `identifiers` as well as the `name`.

**Naming of MQTT entities**

Naming of MQTT entities has been changed to be aligned with the
[entity naming guidelines](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/#entity-naming):

- The `has_entity_name` entity will be set to `True` on all MQTT entities.
- This means any MQTT entity which is part of a device will [automatically have it's `friendly_name` attribute prefixed with the device name](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/#has_entity_name-true-mandatory-for-new-integrations).
- Unnamed `binary_sensor`, `button`, `event`, `number` and `sensor` entities will
  now be named by their device class instead of being named "MQTT binary sensor" etc.
- It's now allowed to set an MQTT entity's name to `None` to mark it as the
  main feature of a device.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Philips Dynalite" %}

The Dynalite configuration panel, which previously was on the Home Assistant
side bar, has moved. It now can be accessed via the integration page in
**Settings** -> **Device & services** -> **Dynalite** -> **Configure**.

[#96853]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/96853

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Renson" %}

The state values of the Reason Ventilation integration have been changed to
be more consistent with other integrations, and are now lowercase. Additionally,
it can now provide translations for the state values in the UI.

This means that the following state values have changed:

- `Off` -> `off`
- `Level1` -> `level1`
- `Level2` -> `level2`
- `Level3` -> `level3`
- `Level4` -> `level4`
- `Breeze` -> `breeze`
- `Holiday` -> `holiday`

Please update any automations where you are using the state of this Renson sensor.
